We are working with a scenario of Reinforcement Learning where we are applying
the letter O as a wanderer. That wanderer wants to get the treasure T  to get its reward.
The condition looks like this:
O-----T
The wanderer tries to find the quickest path to reach the treasure. During each
episode, the steps the wanderer takes to reach the treasure are counted. With each
episode, the condition improves and the number of steps declines.
